## Thought Transfer Engine (MCP)

The engine shuttles compact context between agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP):

- Capture: extract minimal sufficient context packets
- Refine: run PMCRO cycle to optimize packets
- Emit: publish refined packets for the next loop or agents

This enables efficient, recursive self-improvement without overwhelming context windows.
